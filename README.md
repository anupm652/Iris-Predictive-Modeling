# Iris Predictive Modeling Project

This project demonstrates predictive modeling on the Iris dataset using Scikit-Learn. The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species based on their features.

## Steps:
1. Data preprocessing and splitting.
2. Model training (k-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression).
3. Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix).

## Files:
- `iris_modeling.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the analysis.
